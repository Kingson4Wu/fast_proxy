/**
Go language has built-in several compression algorithms, including:

gzip: gzip is a widely used compression algorithm on the web. It uses Lempel-Ziv algorithm (LZ77) and Huffman coding to compress data and can be easily used with the HTTP protocol.

zlib: zlib is a compression algorithm used in many applications. It uses the DEFLATE algorithm to compress data and can also be used with the HTTP protocol.

LZW: LZW algorithm is a commonly used lossless compression algorithm, often used for lossless compression of text files.

bzip2: bzip2 is an efficient compression algorithm that is more efficient than gzip and zlib but slower. It is suitable for compressing large files.

snappy: Snappy is a compression algorithm developed by Google. It is fast but has a relatively low compression ratio and is suitable for scenarios that require fast compression and decompression of data.

The specific choice of compression algorithm depends on the application scenario and requirements. For example, if it needs to be used in a web application, gzip or zlib may be a better choice; if it needs to compress large files, bzip2 can be chosen; if it needs fast compression and decompression of data, snappy can be considered.

For compressing and decompressing large files, it is recommended to use bzip2 or LZ4 algorithm.

bzip2 is an efficient compression algorithm with a high compression ratio, suitable for compressing large files. Its disadvantage is that the compression speed is relatively slow, but it is suitable for scenarios that require long-term storage or transferring files to remote areas.

LZ4 is a very fast compression algorithm with fast compression and decompression speeds and a relatively high compression ratio. It is suitable for compressing and decompressing large files. Its disadvantage is that the compression ratio is relatively low, making it unsuitable for compressing files that require long-term storage.

The specific choice of algorithm depends on the size of the file and the compression efficiency. Generally, if the file size exceeds several hundred megabytes or even several gigabytes, bzip2 can be considered for compression; if the file size is below several tens of megabytes, LZ4 can be considered for compression.
